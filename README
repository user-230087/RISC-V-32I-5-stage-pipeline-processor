# 🚀 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor (RV32I)

This project is a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. The processor follows a classic 5-stage pipeline: **IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB** — enabling instruction-level parallelism, performance efficiency, and modular design.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The processor is built with the following five pipeline stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**  
   - Fetches instruction from instruction memory using the PC.

2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**  
   - Decodes the instruction, reads source registers, and computes immediate values.

3. **Execute (EX)**  
   - Performs ALU operations or computes effective addresses.

4. **Memory Access (MEM)**  
   - Accesses data memory for load/store instructions.

5. **Write Back (WB)**  
   - Writes results back to the register file.
